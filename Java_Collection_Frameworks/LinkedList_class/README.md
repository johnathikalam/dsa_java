# LinkedList Class

Method & Description: 
- *boolean add(E e)* : This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

- *boolean addAll(Collection<? extends E> c)* : This method appends all of the elements in the specified collection to the end of this list, in the order that they are returned by the specified collection's iterator.

- *void addFirst(E e)* : This method returns inserts the specified element at the beginning of this list.

- *void addLast(E e)* : This method returns appends the specified element to the end of this list.

- *void clear()* :  This method removes all of the elements from this list.

- *Object clone()* : This method returns returns a shallow copy of this LinkedList.

- *boolean contains(Object o)* : This method returns true if this list contains the specified element.

- *Iterator<E> descendingIterator()* : This method returns an iterator over the elements in this deque in reverse sequential order.

- *E element()* : This method retrieves, but does not remove, the head (first element) of this list.

- *E get(int index)* : This method returns the element at the specified position in this list.

- *E getFirst()* : This method returns the first element in this list.

- *E getLast()* : This method returns the last element in this list.

- *int indexOf(Object o)* : This method returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified element in this list, or -1 if this list does not contain the element.

- *int lastIndexOf(Object o)* : This method returns the index of the last occurrence of the specified element in this list, or -1 if this list does not contain the element.

- *ListIterator<E> listIterator(int index)* : This method returns a list-iterator of the elements in this list (in proper sequence), starting at the specified position in the list.

- *boolean offer(E e)* : This method adds the specified element as the tail (last element) of this list.

- *boolean offerFirst(E e)* : This method inserts the specified element at the front of this list.

- *boolean offerLast(E e)* : This method inserts the specified element at the end of this list.

- *E peek()* : This method retrieves, but does not remove, the head (first element) of this list.

- *E peekFirst()* : This method retrieves, but does not remove, the first element of this list, or returns null if this list is empty.

- *E peekLast()* : This method retrieves, but does not remove, the last element of this list, or returns null if this list is empty.

- *E poll()* : This method retrieves and removes the head (first element) of this list.

- *E pollFirst()* : This method retrieves and removes the first element of this list, or returns null if this list is empty.

- *E pollLast()* : This method retrieves and removes the last element of this list, or returns null if this list is empty.

- *E pop()* : This method pops an element from the stack represented by this list.

- *void push(E e)* : This method pushes an element onto the stack represented by this list.

- *E remove()* : This method retrieves and removes the head (first element) of this list.

- *E removeFirst()* : This method removes and returns the first element from this list.

- *boolean removeFirstOccurrence(Object o)* : This method removes the first occurrence of the specified element in this list (when traversing the list from head to tail).

- *E removeLast()* : This method removes and returns the last element from this list.

- *boolean removeLastOccurrence(Object o)* : This method removes the last occurrence of the specified element in this list (when traversing the list from head to tail).

- *E set(int index, E element)* : This method replaces the element at the specified position in this list with the specified element.

- *int size()* : This method returns the number of elements in this list.

- *Spliterator<E> spliterator()* : This method creates a late-binding and fail-fast Spliterator over the elements in this list.

- *Object[] toArray()* : This method returns an array containing all of the elements in this list in proper sequence (from first to last element).
