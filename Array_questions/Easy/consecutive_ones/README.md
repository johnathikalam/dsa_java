# Count Maximum Consecutive One's in the array

Problem Statement: Given an array that contains only 1 and 0 return the count of maximum consecutive ones in the array.

Example 1:

Input: prices = {1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1}

Output: 3

Explanation: There are two consecutive 1’s and three consecutive 1’s in the array out of which maximum is 3.

Input: prices = {1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1} 

Output: 2

Explanation: There are two consecutive 1's in the array. 

### Approach:  We maintain a variable count that keeps a track of the number of consecutive 1’s while traversing the array. The other variable max_count maintains the maximum number of 1’s, in other words, it maintains the answer.

We start traversing from the beginning of the array. Since we can encounter either a 1 or 0 there can be two situations:-

If  the value at the current index is equal to 1 we increase the value of count by one. After updating  the count variable if it becomes more than the max_count  update the max_count.
If the value at the current index is equal to zero we make the variable count as 0 since there are no more consecutive ones.

### Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: O(N) since the solution involves only a single pass.

Space Complexity: O(1) because no extra space is used.
