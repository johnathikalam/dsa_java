# Insertion Sort Algorithm

Problem Statement: Given an array of N integers, write a program to implement the Insertion sorting algorithm.

Examples:

Example 1:
Input: N = 6, array[] = {13,46,24,52,20,9}
Output: 9,13,20,24,46,52
Explanation: 
After sorting the array is: 9,13,20,24,46,52


Example 2:
Input: N=5, array[] = {5,4,3,2,1}
Output: 1,2,3,4,5
Explanation: After sorting the array is: 1,2,3,4,5

### Approach: 

- Select an element in each iteration from the unsorted array(using a loop).
- Place it in its corresponding position in the sorted part and shift the remaining elements accordingly (using an inner loop and swapping).
- The “inner while loop” basically shifts the elements using swapping.

### Complexity Analysis

- Best Case Time Complexity: 

The best case occurs if the given array is already sorted. And if the given array is already sorted, the outer loop will only run and the inner loop will run for 0 times. So, our overall time complexity in the best case will boil down to O(N), where N = size of the array.
